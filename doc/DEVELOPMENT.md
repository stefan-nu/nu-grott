# Development

The source code is independent from the used development system. That means
you can use any kind of editor or development system as you like.

However if you have no experiance with python development you can 
speed up your learning experiance by using on of the well suited python IDEs.

Before you can start develping or debugging the source code you need to 
get the code and python installed on your computer. The document USAGE.md 
describes how to do so.

Here are given some examples to get you started with development and debugging.

\todo add here a description how to 
- install the IDE
- install git
- get the sourcecode
- import the sourcecode to the IDE
- perform typical tasks in the IDE

typical build environments

* eclipse with pydev
* pycharm
* visual studio
