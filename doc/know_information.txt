This document collects some useful information about the Growatt communication
protocol and how it is processed by nu-grott


Record with length <=12 ist an ACK 

80 Protocol Types

00  ?
02	unencrypted data ohne crc
05	encrypted   data mit  16bit crc 
06	encrypted   data mit  16bit crc 



Device Numbers

01 shinewifi or shinelan
5x shinelink


Header layout

a header is 8 bytes long oder sind es nur 6 Bytes?
thus 16 hex strings

A header starts with a fixed value \x00\x0d\x00 ?

Byte    Hex    Meaning     typical value
0 		 0:  2 start       = 00 
1 		 2:  4 unknown2    = 01,02,03,0f,10,15,1a,1e 
2 		 4:  6 unknown3    = 00
3 		 6:  8 protocol    = 06
4,5 	 8: 12 content_len big endian format
6		12: 14 deviceno    = 01
7		15: 16 type/cmd    = 03,16,19


Header example
0001000600240119
0001000600250119
0001000600260119
0002000600030103
00020006033f0103
0003000600200116
000f000600200116
0010000600200116
0015000600200116
001a000600200116
001e000600200116



Crc is calculated over header and encrypted data
Header and CRC itself is not encrypted

Layout means a string of the format

T010203
T  - starting character is always T
01 - protocol
02 - device number 
03 - record type

T060116 mein Inverter vermutlich ACK message
06 - protocol
01 - device number
16 - record type



Unknown information

ALO
What is a registergroup

ALO_3000_3124
ALO_3125_3249
ALO_3250_3280


T060137 Layout (protocol 06, device 01, record type 37)

Shine commands

001f -> Time set command
0011 -> Change IP command



    # Currently three types of layout descriptions are known:
    # - "Clasic" inverters (eg. 1500-S) for Grott
    # - "New type" Inverters  (TL-X, TL3, MAD, MIX, MAX, MIX, SPA, SPH )
    # - "SPF" Inverters, not yet covered in the AutoCreateLayout, while detection interferes with Classic type detection.

    
    
Kommand 80 ACK

The command 80 = 0x50 contains one data byte which is always 0
Maybe the data can be different from 0 but I did not see that so far.
I guess 0 means ACK, and other values some kind of error
The command has a CRC
The transaction number gets incremented by 1 for every message
It seems to be an ACK message as a data message with the same
transaction number occurs right before the ACK message
It occurs every 35 seconds with some seconds of deviation
Maybe the time difference between the messages can be used to say
something about the internal state of the sender or receiver
 
 
Kommand 22 Ping

A ping command has a sequence number which is incremented


Kommand 55

used by MID inverter

sequence number gets incremented with every message
when the message was blocked
