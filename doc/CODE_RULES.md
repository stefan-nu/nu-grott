## Coding rules

The coding rules have been limited to the most basic rules that apply to 
an programming language. Good programming involves far more. But if you 
follow these basic rules, your code will automatically be of high quality. 

1 Write code for humans not for computers
* 1a write self-explanatory and speaking code 
* 1b don't annoy your reader
* 1c stick to the same coding style
	
2 No secrets in your code
* 2a no magic numbers
* 2b don't lie
* 2c don't hide information
	
3 Avoid redundancy and inconsistancy
* 3a don't repeat yourself (DRY)
* 3b every thing has its own and single place
	
4 Comment well
* 4a use as few comments as possible, prefer self-explanatory code to comments
* 4b explain why, not how or what
* 4c explain complex / complicated parts
* 4d keep comments in sync with code

5 Write easy code
* 5a Keep it simple and stupid (KISS)
* 5b make things as short as possible, but not shorter
* 5c make equal things look equal, hence highlight differences
* 5d no dead code

6 Write clean code
* 6a keep the scope as small as possible
* 6b use the least amount of information possible
* 6c prefer constants to changeable objects
* 6d every module does one thing only

7 Aim for 100% test coverage
* 7a every line is covered by a unit test
* 7b every condition is covered by a unit test
* 7c every option is covered by a system test
